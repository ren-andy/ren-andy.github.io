				<h3 class="major">Introduction - Andy</h3>
				<p> Hi everyone! Thanks for dropping by :) </p>
				<p> I'm a 2A Computer Engineering student, and I'm running to be your next engineering councilor!</p>
				<p> Before we move on, here's just a few random facts about me:
					<ul>
						<li>I just finished 1B Computer Engineering this spring term, and I'm interning as a software
							developer at VirtaMove in Ottawa </li>
						<li> I play three musical instruments - Piano, Alto Saxophone, and Percussion </li>

						<li>I speak 3 languages fluently (English, Français, and 普通话)</li>
					</ul>

				</p>
				<h3 class="major">Experience</h3>
				<p>
					Throughout high school, I've had the privledge of serving on a number of student advisory committes,
					finding ways to
					help others in my community.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my senior year of high school, I served as Student Senator, representing 1200+ students and
					parents of my
					high school at the school board level. I've personally worked with elected adult trustees on serious
					issues concerning students of the day. For example, I was able to provide direct input on
					implementing IB at a new high school in the west end of the city, I participated in
					consultations on the board operating budget, and I was part of a group that hosted a
					student conference on graduate exit outcomes and board policy. My experience encompassed working
					with elected
					officials and stakeholders and passing legislation has allowed me to gain solid experience in
					ensuring that the needs of students are met and that their voices are heard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, I also was a member of my Member of Parliament's youth council. Here, I worked with
					other students in my constituency to develop methods for the Federal Government to tackle the opioid
					crisis.
				</p>
				<p>
					And lastly, in first year, I served for two terms as a class representative to First-Year
					Engineering, which
					coincided with a few major scandals that occurred within my engineering cohort. I made it my
					personal goal
					during those terms to mitigate miscommunication and rumors being passed around and to ensure that
					First-Year's message was being transmitted to the proper channels. Furthermore, I also made sure
					that student concerns regarding the many diverse issues (i.e Removing hell week, workload) were
					addressed by First-year as well.
				</p>
				<h3 class="major">Next steps -Standing up for you</h3>
				<p> I'm running for councilor, because I'm passionate about student advocacy and helping others,
					because I want to make sure that we're getting things done, that student
					issues are being addressed, and because we need a councilor to help ensure WUSA executive is aware
					of the needs
					of
					engineering students and
					can then take proper action.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of my fellow candidates have promised specific things, some have even promised memes. However,
					in my
					experience, this is a position that requires having conversations with students over time and being
					serious about standing up for their rights. It is one thing to promise major sweeping changes, but
					it
					is a completely different beast to implement those promises.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a side note, I also wanted to mention one thing that really inspired me in first-year, was that I
					was able to witness direct results of the
					advocacy FEDS/WUSA has done for students. For example, some of the advocacy included
					consultation on student fees policy, standing up to the provincial government on OSAP cuts,
					investing in legal services, or even switching to 2 ply toilet paper (:^)), these are just a few
					things
					that were brought up <b><i>by students</i></b>, are being implemented or is being actively addressed
					for students,
					and are the now the models for what we need to continue to fight for.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, as your councilor, I pledge to-
					<ul>
						<li><b>Be a passionate advocate for all engineering students at the university, provincial, and
								federal level, ensuring that no student is left out,
							</b></li>
						<li><b>Make sure that every measure I propose at the council table will be with full
								consultation and
								in the best interest of all engineering students,
							</b></li>
						<li><b>Push for an organizational framework to tackle recurring issues such as (but not
								limited to)
								mental health, OSAP, and student fees. The goal is to increase organizational
								transparency and student
								involvement in
								formulating new policy for the years to come.
							</b></li>
					</ul>

					With my experience advocating for student voice for the past few years, I hope I can earn your vote
					as your voice as engineering councilor on October 9th-10th.
