      Hi! &#x1F44B, I'm Andy, a Computer Engineering Student at the University of
      Waterloo. <br />
      Some of my interests include embedded software development and
      healthcare.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I have free time (not spent studying), I enjoy lifting weights, 
      researching about fitness, reading history, watching sports, and ocassionally
      jamming on the piano. Just to name a few... Oh! and if I think of something cool, 
      I try to work on new software projects too &#x1F468&#x200D&#x1F4BB
    </p>

    <p>Here's some of my most recent experiences &#x1f4bb:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sept-Dec 2019 - Software Developer Intern @ <a href="https://virtamove.com">VirtaMove</a></li>
      <li>Jan-Apr 2019 - Web Analyst @ <a href="https://agr.gc.ca/">Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada</a></li>
      <li>Aug 2017-Jul 2018 - Student Senator @ <a href="https://OCDSB.ca/">OCDSB</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find a more complete description of my experience in my resume <a href="./Resume_2B_v3.pdf">here</a></p>

    <p>Here's some of my school activities <img src="./assets/waterloologo.png" class="emoji-like-img" />:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>May 2020-Present - VP Academic @ ECE Society </li>
        <li>Oct 2019-May 2020 - Student Councillor @ WUSA </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm a firm believer in student advocacy. Since I was in high school, 
      I've always been involved in advocating for student voice and promoting the interests of students. 
      I think this is important to ensure that students have a say in how their education is delivered. 
    </p>

    <p>Here's some projects I've created:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ren-andy/home-monitor">home-monitor</a> - Small sensor-based embedded system created using a RPi and C++ &#x1F3E0</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ren-andy/cuhacking-app">CareerCounsel</a>: - Job posting skills and qualification aggregator &#x1F4BC</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the future, I hope to be able to develop innovative ideas that can hopefully positively impact the lives of others.</p>
